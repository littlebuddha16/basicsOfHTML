    <h1>A Guide to buy a DSLR Camera</h1>

    <h2>Intro to DSLR:</h2>
    <p>A DSLR also called Digital SLR or Digital Single-Lens Reflex camera works
      exactly like a single-lens reflex camera with a digital image processor
      instead of a photographic film. The reflex design is the main difference
      between DSLR and other digital cameras like Mirrorless cameras.</p>
    <p>In the reflex design, the light travels through the lens then to a mirror
      which alternates to send the image to either viewfinder or the image
      sensor. Earlier the traditional cameras would have a viewfinder with it's
      lens, hence, the term single-lens for this design. Mirrorless cameras
      would not have a mirror between the lens and image sensor or viewfinder.
      The absence of mirror makes them smaller in size and slightly better
      for low-light photography.</p>
    <p>The DSLRs are usually categorised based on the size of the image sensor.
       The two main categories of them are:</p>
    <h3>Full-frame DSLRs:</h3>
    <p>"Full-frame" image sensors are same size as 35 mm film(36 X 24 mm).
      Because of larger sensor, full-frame cameras tend to be bulky. Even the
      mirrorless cameras which doesn't have a mirror are still bigger in size
      to fit the larger lenses to project the image on to the bigger sensor.
      And it's also expensive to manufacture a full frame sensor, hence,
      full frame DSLRs are not budget friendly.</p>
    <h4>Advantages of Full-frame sensors:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The larger surface area leads to capture more light which results to
        better image quality, especially in low-light conditions</li>
      <li>Better depth of control; In other words, they produce shallower depth
        of field compared to smaller sensors which is called "Bokeh", a desirable
        trait</li>
      <h5>NOTE: Bokeh, the shallower depth of field seperates the subject from
        the background which is popular look in portraiture</h5>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crop-frame DSLRs:</h3>
    <p>Crop-frame sensors are usually in dimensions, 22.2 X 14.8 mm more or less.
      Because of the smaller sensor, they are compact and easy to carry.
      Industries manufacture much more smaller sensors than crop-frame such as
      Foven, micro four thirds etc.,</p>
    <p>Crop-frames have more or less 1.5X crop factor. It means a lens of
      24 mm focal length becomes a 36 mm on crop-sensor bodies. The crop factor
      could be useful in the fields like Wild photography, Macro photography
      etc., But unlike full-frame they are not good options for low-light
      photography and they don't produce bokeh as good as a full-frame body. </p>

    <h4>Advantages of Crop-frame sensors:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Smaller in size</li>
      <li>Crop factor</li>
      <li>Budget friendly</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>If you are a beginner photographer or just want to take candid
       pictures at parties and functions, I would suggest a crop-frame DSLR or
       even smaller than crop sensor. Crop sensor bodies are more than enough for
       hobbyists. Learn photography concepts like framing and lighting and get
       skilled. Even then I strongly insist you to invest money in lenses and
       lighting equipment not in buying a bigger sensored body.</p>
    <p>But if you want to be in fashion, wedding business, real-estate or
      professionally sell your work in the market, then yes, by all means buy a
      full frame DSLR, decent glass(lens) and better lighting equipment.
      The camera and accessories are just tools and they don't make you a great
      photographer just because you own them. You still need to learn concepts,
      practise and get skilled.</p>
    <p>Always remember, the best camera you could have is the one you have at the
      moment of capture.</p>
    <h5>Happy Shooting!</h5>

      photography gear based on my personal experiences and I strongly advise
      you to do your own research before buying a DSLR or any other equipment.</h6>
